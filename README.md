Another fun and interactive game app that dynamically updates its HTML pages with the jQuery library.

The game will reset with a loss, as I 
wanted it to. There is a glitch in the 
game that will sometimes display an EVEN 
random number with only ODD valued 
crystals and vice-versa. I guess that's 
a code to learn for the future to avoid 
such glitches that inevitably end with a 
loss.
