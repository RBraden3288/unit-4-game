# unit-4-game
Another fun and interactive game app that dynamically updates its HTML pages with the jQuery library.

After working the game from multiple angles (adding/deleting/re-writing functions), I could only get the game to work with 
1.) a working random number and match reset after a win or 2.)a working point increment system that alerts the correct number of wins-- not both, simultaneously.

The game will reset with a loss, as I wanted it to.
There is a glitch in the game that will sometimes display an EVEN random number with only ODD valued crystals and vice-versa.
I guess that's a code to learn for the future to avoid such glitches that inevitable end with a loss.
